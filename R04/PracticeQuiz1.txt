Practice Quiz 1

This practice quiz has 2 parts.
Part I is easier and I hope everyone can complete it in class
Part II is more challenging, but it might be possible to complete it too.
Download the pq1 folder from R04 in github to start
Upload your solutions to Part I and Part II to the Peer Review App
and later tonight make comments on at least 3 other students solutions.
You may ask each other and your mentor for help for this practice quiz
but you may not get any help on the actual quiz next Tuesday.



Part I.
Your job is to write the CarPool class according to the following specification:

The CarPool class represent a carpooling vehicle.
It has a constructor that allows you to create a Carpool by specifying
* The name of the owner of the car, e.g. "Tim Hickey"
* The pick up place, e.g. "Coolidge Corner"
* The pick up time  e.g. "8 am"
* The departure time, e.g. "5 pm"
* The number of possible carpoolers e.g. 4
These values should be stored in private instance variables.
You should write the constructor to create a carpool object from this information,
e.g.
CarPool car = new CarPool("Tim Hickey","Coolidge Corner","8 am","5 pm", 4);

You should write the following instance methods:

toString() method which will produce the following String
representation for the object:
car.toString() -->
carpool(Tim Hickey leaves Coolidge Corner at 8 am returns 5 pm has 4 available seats)

addRider() --> which decreases the number of available seats by 1,

removeRider() --> which increases the number of available seats by 1,

getAvailableSeats() --> which returns the number of available getAvailableSeats

You can assume the user will not try to add too many riders or remove a rider from an empty car.

****************************************************************(
Here is the result you should get when you complete Part I

% java pq1.TestCarPool


Initial Cars
car #0: carpool(Tim Hickey leaves Coolidge Corner at 8 am returns 5 pm has 4 available seats)
car #1: carpool(Pito Salas leaves Lexington Center at 10 am returns 6 pm has 4 available seats)
car #2: carpool(Bruno Mars leaves Harvard Square at 11 am returns 9 pm has 1 available seats)


Load the Cars 2 in car0, 4 in car1, 1 in car 2
car #0: carpool(Tim Hickey leaves Coolidge Corner at 8 am returns 5 pm has 2 available seats)


Change the Riders: 1 in car0, 3 from car1, 1 from car 2
car #0: carpool(Tim Hickey leaves Coolidge Corner at 8 am returns 5 pm has 1 available seats)
car #1: carpool(Pito Salas leaves Lexington Center at 10 am returns 6 pm has 3 available seats)
car #2: carpool(Bruno Mars leaves Harvard Square at 11 am returns 9 pm has 1 available seats)

****************************************************************

If you can complete Part I, then work on Part II.
In any case, you should complete this at home and comment on at least 3 other students'
solutions to Part I and Part II.

Part II.

Copy your solution to a new folder pq1a
and modify it so that it adds and removes riders by name and returns the list of current riders.
Remove the old addRider and removeRider methods and replace them with
addRider(name)
removeRider(name)
getCurrentRiders() --> returns array of names of current riders
getAvailableSeats() --> returns number of available seats
Also modify toString so that it also shows the names of the riders...

Also add code to throw an Exception if they try to add a rider to a full car or remove a rider from an empty car.

Also modify the TestCarPool code so that it tests these features and throws an exception if they incorrect add or remove riders.

****************************************************************
Here is an example of what the correct output should be for the Part II version.
